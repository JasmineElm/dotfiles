# Dotfiles

My cleansed dotfiles. Should work across OSX/Debian/Termux. Most of this will be irrelevant, but the .shell functions may be worth a glance.

These files are used (and should work) across OSX, WSL, Debian and Termux. Minimal tweaking may be required on OSX and termux, though I've yet to find anything obviously broken.
